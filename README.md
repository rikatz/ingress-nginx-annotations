# Ingress NGINX annotations

This package is a fork of the [annotations package](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/internal/ingress/annotations) 
from Ingress NGINX.

The intent is that these annotations, its validations and its structure can be used 
by migration CLIs like ingress2gateway.

This is for now a WIP without a well defined API/interface, and may change over time.
